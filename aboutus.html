I joined the Lexington Computer Science Team in its early stages, and feel lucky to have enjoyed its opportunities and enrichment throughout all of our projects, including the exciting upcoming Patriot Points Walk. Being obsessed with computer games at a young age, I had been introduced to computer science early, but didn’t become interested in it until high school. These days I enjoy watching and playing soccer, volleyball, and video games.</p>

I am a huge Patriots fan(the football patriots, not the militia patriots) and I can basically name every player on it. In school, my favorite subjects are computer science, biology, and gym. Outside of school you might see me playing frisbee with my friends in the center. I had the opportunity to work on the Patriots Day miles project, and it was a good experience. Hope to see you around someday. </p>

I first started my programming journey in 6th grade, learning to make simple websites. Then as time goes on, I’m more and more enthusiastic about computers. Many of my memorable days are times when I did something very cool. I’ve hosted my own website, made Android apps and uploaded them to stores, and I learned all these by myself. It has always been fun learning about computers.</p>
