                        <p class = "mb-2">Alicia: Hi, everyone. I'm Alicia Li. I'm an incoming student at MIT. So in high school, I mostly
                            did a lot of math and computer science stuff. So the biggest thing I did was MIT Primes,
                            which is a research program. So I did adversarial reinforcement learning research for two
                            years and then the year before that, I studied theory of computation. And then the two years
                            before that, I did recreational math research all at MIT primes. Outside of primes. I also
                            founded a nonprofit called Watch to Donate. And we essentially provided people ways to
                            donate to charity for free. So we did this by developing two mobile apps where people can 
                            play games and
                            then the revenue is donated. I'm really combining my passion for computer science and
                            technology to help others. Outside of that I was also involved in Lexington
                            Conversation, which aims to diversify our school curriculum, as well as I
                            danced for 15 years and I was part of the math team and also Lex MACS, which is the math
                            and computer science club.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Audi: Hi, I am Audi. My main activities in high school are robotics and swimming. For
                            swimming I did for many, many years, like 15 years-ish. For robotics I picked up in middle
                            school and continued to follow that throughout high school. I also did a lot of other clubs: like.
                            school store, debate, band, frisbee, and softball. Outside of school. I did mostly swimming and
                            a decent amount of tutoring and teaching. Over the summers, I intended to do more summer
                            camps instead of research..
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Ellen: Hi, my name is Ellen. I'm a rising freshman at Stanford University. I have been on
                            the US National Junior and Cadet fencing team and represented the US to compete in
                            many countries for the sport. I served as editor in chief of the LHS
                            school newspaper - the Musket and was also elected for three years as one of the four class
                            officers of the LHS class of 2023 Student Council. I'm also part of the Lexington Youth STEAM
                            team, a writing teacher for middle school students at a non-profit organization, and I have co-
                            authored academic research papers.
                        </p>

                            Eli: I'm an incoming freshman at Harvard. I plan on doing computer science and philosophy
                            and in high school, I played soccer a lot. That was a big thing that I did outside. I also coded
                            my video games. I created a custom newsletter and reached out to local newspapers here,
                            particularly the Lexington observer. I then created a Lex budget simulator which basically told
                            how much of your tax money was going to which things so I built the website for that.
                            And then on top of that, I also was the captain of the Lexington soccer team. And that was
                            kind of my main extracurriculars, and I've also done tutoring on the side and have hosted a
                            moderator issue discussion group. So those were kind of my main activities.
                        </p>

                            Isabel Li : Hi, I am Isabel and I am an incoming freshman in Harvard University in
                            Neuroscience. Most of my time outside of school is at Ballet. I competed in Youth American
                            Grand Prix, universal ballet competition etc. and qualified as a finalist. I think dance was an
                            activity that was closest to my heart just because I just love the community so much.
                            I also found it a pen pal club and ran my own business where I taught English to kids in China.
                            I published biochemistry research, volunteered in simulated organizations and shadowed
                            interns during the summers.
                            I was also co-president of the youth against Alzheimer's club and on the side I ran a
                            baking fundraiser with friends and won gold at our regional competition.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Jamie: Hi, people. My name is Jamie. I am also an incoming freshman at Stanford this year
                            along with Ellen, and like Ellen I spent some of my high school fencing although not
                            nearly as much as she did. And in high school. I was the co-captain of Science Olympiad,
                            which is a science club and also a co-captain of the National Ocean Sciences bowl along with
                            Pria here, and Envirothon. I did a lot of school science clubs, mostly in the fields of earth
                            science as well as engineering so I did a lot of building things and a lot of talking about Earth.
                            And in Envirothon, I spent a lot of time talking with the Town legislature about town budgets,
                            etc.
                            I did some research for a while on ocean thermal energy conversion. I was also part of the
                            United States Earth Science team and competed internationally in 2021. And since then, I've
                            been a mentor at the team. And in my free time I do spend a lot of time outside. I spend a lot
                            of time hiking, running etc.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Jason: Hey, I'm Jason. I am planning to go to UMass Amherst for computer science and
                            philosophy. I guess my biggest thing that I did during high school was that I participated in a
                            summer project at Microsoft working for a car manufacturing company using augmented reality
                            with AI visuals like detection of text as well as finding machine manuals on factory
                            floors to improve worker safety.
                            After that, I also worked a little bit on making up a book but I didn't finish it in time. But I was
                            working on a book for the consequence, this of like the AI explosion we see right now and like
                            the ethical implications that in society so I was working on that. On the side. I did a lot of
                            tutoring at different places. I taught tennis for like five years. I also did piano and
                            then I volunteered at some clubs in school. I volunteered in a club where we like revamped the
                            LHS school website. So that was pretty fun.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Lotem: Hi, everyone. I'm Lotem. I'm also a rising first year at Harvard. Throughout high
                            school, I attempted to be involved in a range of extracurriculars that shifted throughout my four
                            years, which mirrored and also in birth, my personal development. I forgot to mention that I'm
                            planning on studying psychology and biology. My biggest activities were project 851, which is
                            actually outside of LHS. It's a youth service organization which encourages eighth graders
                            across Massachusetts to learn to serve in their communities. I started off in eighth grade.
                            And then throughout my four years in high school, I assumed different mentorship and
                            leadership roles. I also worked for, or I volunteered for a Russian School of Math mentorship
                            program, which works with elementary school students. And then I became the Executive
                            Chair for that for two years. During the summers I mostly focused on volunteering at camps
                            and doing a lot of photography activities. I also was in a bunch of clubs at LHS including folio,
                            the art magazine where I was an art editor. I was a leader for the senior pen pals club, and I
                            had a few other things and I started off by playing soccer on the JV girls’ team. But I decided
                            during the pandemic that that wasn't really for me. Throughout my high school career, I
                            assumed different roles in different clubs and was mostly using it as a way to feel comfortable
                            in my extracurricular skin, my academic skin and also just for myself.
                        </p>

                            Priya: Hi, my name is Priya. I'm an incoming freshman at MIT along with Alicia. So going into
                            high school, one of my biggest things was showjumping. I rode horses competitively for
                            almost 13 years of my life. So that was one of the biggest things I did. Along with that I also
                            worked at my barn so I was teaching younger students and I also volunteered at a local
                            therapeutic riding facility. And then going into high school, I continued with science bowl. I
                            kept mentoring the local middle school diamond Science Bowl team. And I also started a
                            National Oceanic Science Bowl, which I ended up being a co-captain along with
                            Jamie, but instead of earth science, I was studying marine biology. And then in COVID, riding
                            kind of stopped for me, and I picked up robotics and I ended up being a club co-
                            captain for one of LHS robotics teams for 292 Bits to Byte and so on that I competed in
                            FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge). Throughout my summers, my first summers were primarily more
                            summer camps teaching for local math camps. I got my sailing certification, stuff like that. And
                            then as I got older, I spent one summer working in a corporate lab, doing kind of biomedical
                            chemical engineering research and then my last summer working at a Harvard MIT affiliated
                            kind of biotech lab that was more academic and less corporate.</p>
